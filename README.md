# How to start
This is a weather app that allows the user to find out the weather of any city in the world. It will display today's weather and weather for the up-coming 5 days.
It includes a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name will perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.
This app displays the weather conditions:
- city
- date
- weather icon
- temp
- humidity
- wind speed
- UV Index

You will find the app here:
